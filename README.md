## 🗺️ Roadmap: The Minimalist Overhaul

We are currently transitioning **TaskFlow** from a desktop-centric layout to a **mobile-first, gesture-driven** minimalist powerhouse.

### Phase 1: The "Invisible" UI
- [ ] **Bottom Navigation**: Moving all controls to a mobile-friendly bottom tab bar (Today / Add / All).
- [ ] **FAB (Floating Action Button)**: Implementing a centralized "Quick Add" trigger.
- [ ] **Whitespace Zenith**: Removing heavy borders and lines for a digital-paper feel.

### Phase 2: Intelligence & Motion
- [ ] **NLP Input**: Type "Gym tomorrow at 6pm" and let TaskFlow handle the scheduling automatically.
- [ ] **Swipe Gestures**: Swipe right to reschedule to tomorrow; swipe left to archive.
- [ ] **Long-press**: Deep-dive editing triggered by touch duration.

### Phase 3: Connected & Silent
- [ ] **Local Notifications**: Direct-to-device reminders for upcoming deadlines.
- [ ] **Cloud-Lite Sync**: Optional Firebase/Cloud integration for cross-device usage.
